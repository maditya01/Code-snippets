What could be the template for stack.
iterate for loop from 0:n-1{ 
while(pop ke condition when you want to pop){}
push->s[i]
}
just iterate stack and push answer in ans. reverse ans 
return ans.

  //I have to create incresing stack, I have to create decreasing stack.
  //I have to tell next greater element for each element of an array.
  //We have 4 options NGL(next greater left side), NGR(next greater right side), NSL(next smallest Left), NSR(next smallest right side)
