//Code How to Think in terms of DP.
//We have 2 types of recursion Parametrised Recursion,Functional Recursion 
//In DP we mostly used Functional Recursion
Take a Data_Structure for storing DP value initialise with -1;
return_type recursive_DP(input arguments){
//Base Case:

//DP condition Check


//Find out all The choices
i) 2 choices take or not_take
ii) n choices use For loop

return best Posible answer from these Choices.
