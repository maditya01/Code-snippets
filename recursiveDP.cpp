//Here we are not thinking in term of DP state
//Here we are more concern about how to find choices and how to write recursion and recurrance relation

//Code How to Think in terms of DP.
//We have 2 types of recursion Parametrised Recursion,Functional Recursion 
//In DP we mostly used Functional Recursion
Take a Data_Structure for storing DP value initialise with -1;
return_type recursive_DP(input arguments){

//Base Case:
 return answer for base Case.

//DP condition Check


//Find out all The choices
i) 2 choices take or not_take
ii) n choices use For loop always return outside the for loop

return [stored in dp] = best Posible answer from these Choices.
}
